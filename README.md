## Requirements

## Installation

PineKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PineKit", git: "https://github.com/1985apps/PineKit.git"
```

## Dependecies
PineKit uses some to the best support Pods out there. Currently the list of pods which PineKit installs are
- SnapKit
- Cartography
- Alamofire

Do see that these pods are included in your Podfile (as a fail safe). And you would find them extremely useful too :)

- UI Elements (PineTextField, PineLabel, PineRadioGroup, ...)
- Layout Elements (PineLinearLayout, PineMenuViewController, ...)
